        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi, thanks for checking out my site! My name's Stephen and this is my resume. 
            Please don't mind how it looks - web development is not my strong suit! 
            This is my attempt at the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/">Cloud Resume Challenge</a>,
            which I discovered while looking for ways to put into practice the knowledge that I gained from
            passing the AWS Certified Developer - Associate exam.  
         </p>
